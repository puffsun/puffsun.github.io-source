My name is George Sun, I'm an full-stack Web software developer, working at EMC Shanghai COE. But the contents in this blog has nothing to do with my work, basically they're my thoughts on software programming, it's just **Yet Another Tech Blog**.

I blog about what I'm learning now, what I have learned in the past. To be specific, most of them will be tutorials on *Web technologies, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Cloud, Golang, Linux*, etc.. If you're interested in them too, don't  hesitate to subscribe my blog's RSS feeds, I appreciate that, also you're welcomed to leave comments on the posts.

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kui_sun), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103092209824087504629), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kui.sun.71) and [Weibo](http://weibo.com/1994207995/profile), you can also reach me by email: sunwinner3[at]gmail.com.

但行好事，莫问前程，与君共勉。
